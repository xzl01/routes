Description: Routing Recognition and Generation Tools for Python 3
 Routes is a Python 3 re-implementation of the Rails routes system for mapping
 URLs to Controllers/Actions and generating URLs. Routes makes it easy to
 create pretty and concise URLs that are RESTful with little effort.
 .
 Speedy and dynamic URL generation means you get a URL with minimal cruft (no
 big dangling query args). Shortcut features like Named Routes cut down on
 repetitive typing.
 .
 Current features:
  * Named Routes
  * Sophisticated Route lookup and URL generation
  * Wildcard path's before and after static parts
  * Groupings syntax to allow flexible URLs to accommodate almost any need
  * Sub-domain support built-in
  * Conditional matching based on domain, cookies, HTTP method (RESTful), and
    more
  * Easily extensible utilizing custom condition functions and route generation
    functions
  * Extensive unit tests
